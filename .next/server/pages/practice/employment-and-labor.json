We believe in the bigger picture. Professionalism does not summarize only the understanding of local laws and international covenants; it also covers our effort to know “our clients, business model, financial position and long-term aspirations.”\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides, legal skills are not the only benefit that we present to our clients. We have a strong professional relationship with high-rank officials in the legislative, judiciary, and executive branches of government which “facilitate communication, ensure fair consideration, and often enable us to reach out directly to resolve potential issues quickly.”","practice_image":{"ID":91,"id":91,"title":"construction","filename":"construction.jpg","filesize":75024,"url":"https://wpbackend.navisa.af/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/construction.jpg","link":"https://wpbackend.navisa.af/praelegal-practices/construction-and-infrastructure/construction/","alt":"","author":"1","description":"","caption":"","name":"construction","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":33,"date":"2021-09-15 05:22:13","modified":"2021-09-15 05:22:13","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https://wpbackend.navisa.af/wp-includes/images/media/default.png","width":960,"height":640,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https://wpbackend.navisa.af/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/construction-150x150.jpg","thumbnail-width":150,"thumbnail-height":150,"medium":"https://wpbackend.navisa.af/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/construction-300x200.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":200,"medium_large":"https://wpbackend.navisa.af/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/construction-768x512.jpg","medium_large-width":750,"medium_large-height":500,"large":"https://wpbackend.navisa.af/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/construction.jpg","large-width":750,"large-height":500,"1536x1536":"https://wpbackend.navisa.af/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/construction.jpg","1536x1536-width":960,"1536x1536-height":640,"2048x2048":"https://wpbackend.navisa.af/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/construction.jpg","2048x2048-width":960,"2048x2048-height":640,"post-thumbnail":"https://wpbackend.navisa.af/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/construction.jpg","post-thumbnail-width":960,"post-thumbnail-height":640}}},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https://wpbackend.navisa.af/wp-json/wp/v2/federal-practices/1142"}],"collection":[{"href":"https://wpbackend.navisa.af/wp-json/wp/v2/federal-practices"}],"about":[{"href":"https://wpbackend.navisa.af/wp-json/wp/v2/types/federal-practices"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https://wpbackend.navisa.af/wp-json/wp/v2/media?parent=1142"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https://api.w.org/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":1132,"date":"2023-01-12T10:31:35","date_gmt":"2023-01-12T06:01:35","guid":{"rendered":"https://wpbackend.navisa.af/?post_type=federal-practices&#038;p=1132"},"modified":"2023-01-21T11:03:04","modified_gmt":"2023-01-21T06:33:04","slug":"construction-litigation","status":"publish","type":"federal-practices","link":"https://wpbackend.navisa.af/federal-practices/construction-litigation/","title":{"rendered":"Construction Litigation"},"content":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"template":"","acf":{"practice_title":"Construction Litigation","practice_description":"2001 and the establishment of Afghanistan’s new government can be highlighted the most for bringing a revolution of construction.
